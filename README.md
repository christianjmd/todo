A simple to-do list web application using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </br>

During my break, I purchased a course from one of my favourite YouTubers, [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q), who teaches basic web design. This project was created after learning the basics of web development from his courses. </br>

You can find the web application here: https://christianjmd.github.io/todo/. </br>
